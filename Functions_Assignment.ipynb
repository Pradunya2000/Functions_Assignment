    "# Ans In Python, there are several ways to define and call functions. Here's a detailed overview of these different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Standard Function Definition\n",
    "# The most common way to define a function is using the def keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function(param1, param2):\n",
    "    return param1 + param2\n",
    "# Call:\n",
    "\n",
    "result = my_function(5, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Lambda Functions\n",
    "#Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: Like a standard function, but without a name directly associated.\n",
    "result = add(5, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Nested Functions\n",
    "#Theory: Functions can be defined inside other functions. This is useful for creating helper functions that are only needed within the scope of the enclosing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "def outer_function(x):\n",
    "    def inner_function(y):\n",
    "        return x + y\n",
    "    return inner_function\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: By calling the outer function, which returns the inner function.\n",
    "inner = outer_function(5)\n",
    "result = inner(10)  # result is 15\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "#Theory: These are functions that either take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This allows for functions that can operate on other functions, enhancing modularity and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def apply_function(func, value):\n",
    "    return func(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: By passing a function as an argument to another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "result = apply_function(square, 5)  # result is 25\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Functions with Default Arguments\n",
    "#Theory: Functions can have default parameter values specified. If an argument is not provided for such parameters, the default value is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    return f\"{message}, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: With or without providing the default argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "result1 = greet(\"Alice\")  # \"Hello, Alice!\"\n",
    "result2 = greet(\"Bob\", \"Hi\")  # \"Hi, Bob!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Keyword Arguments\n",
    "#Theory: Arguments can be passed to functions using the parameter names. This allows for more readable code and flexibility in the order of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):\n",
    "    print(f\"I have a {animal_type} named {pet_name}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: By specifying the argument names in the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "describe_pet(pet_name='Willie')  # Uses default for animal_type\n",
    "describe_pet(pet_name='Harry', animal_type='hamster')\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Variable-Length Arguments\n",
    "#Theory: Functions can accept a variable number of positional or keyword arguments. This is done using *args for positional arguments and **kwargs for keyword arguments, allowing the function to handle more arguments than specified in the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_pizza(size, *toppings):\n",
    "    print(f\"Making a {size} inch pizza with the following toppings:\")\n",
    "    for topping in toppings:\n",
    "        print(f\"- {topping}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):\n",
    "    profile = {'first_name': first, 'last_name': last}\n",
    "    profile.update(user_info)\n",
    "    return profile\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: By passing a varying number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "make_pizza(12, 'pepperoni', 'mushrooms', 'green peppers')\n",
    "profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein', location='princeton', field='physics')\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. Using Function Annotations\n",
    "#Theory: Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary Python expressions at compile time. They can be used for type hints or other metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: The annotations are used for documentation or by external tools but do not affect the function's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(5, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. Recursive Functions\n",
    "#Theory: Recursive functions call themselves within their definition. This is useful for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar tasks, like calculating factorials or traversing trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Call: By invoking the function in a way that eventually leads to a base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "result = factorial(5)  # result is 120\n",
    "\n",
    "#These various methods of defining and calling functions provide flexibility and power in Python programming.\n"

    "# Here are some key points about lambda functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Anonymous Functions:\n",
    "# Lambda functions are also known as nameless functions because they don’t have a formal name.\n",
    "# They are defined inline and can be used directly without assigning them to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Single Expression:\n",
    "# A lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.\n",
    "# The expression is evaluated and returned as the result of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common Use Cases:\n",
    "# Lambda functions are often used for simple tasks, especially when you need a quick function for a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common scenarios include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sorting: As key functions for sorting lists or custom sorting criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtering: As filters for filter() or list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mapping: As mapping functions for map() or list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example of a lambda function that doubles a given number\n",
    "\n",
    "double = lambda x: x * 2\n",
    "print(double(5))  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "#Remember, lambda functions are handy for short-lived operations where a full function definition isn’t necessary."
